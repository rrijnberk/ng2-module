## Examples
This page contains samples for the todo module. As this module consists of several smaller components we showcase 
the full collection of these components as a whole.

### Basic example
This is the default usage of this todo list.
```html
List output: [{{sample.list}}]
<hr />
<rr-todo [(checklist)]="sample.list"></rr-todo>
```

[@example src="todo"]
